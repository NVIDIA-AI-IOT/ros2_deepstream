BaseConfig:
  minDetectorConfidence: 0   # If the confidence of a detector bbox is lower than this, then it won't be considered for tracking

TargetManagement:
  maxTargetsPerStream: 150  # Max number of targets to track per stream. Recommended to set >10. Note: this value should account for the targets being tracked in shadow mode as well. Max value depends on the memory capacity  

  # [Creation & Termination Policy]
  minIouDiff4NewTarget: 0.5   # If the IOU between the newly detected object and any of the existing targets is higher than this threshold, this newly detected object will be discarded.
  probationAge: 4   # If the target's age exceeds this, the target will be considered to be valid.
  maxShadowTrackingAge: 38 # Max length of shadow tracking. If the shadowTrackingAge exceeds this limit, the tracker will be terminated.
  earlyTerminationAge: 1 # If the shadowTrackingAge reaches this threshold while in TENTATIVE period, the target will be terminated prematurely.

TrajectoryManagement:
  useUniqueID: 0   # Use 64-bit long Unique ID when assignining tracker ID.

DataAssociator:
  dataAssociatorType: 0 # the type of data associator among { DEFAULT= 0 }
  associationMatcherType: 0 # the type of matching algorithm among { GREEDY=0, GLOBAL=1 }
  checkClassMatch: 1  # If checked, only the same-class objects are associated with each other. Default: true

  # [Association Metric: Thresholds for valid candidates]
  minMatchingScore4Overall: 0.0   # Min total score
  minMatchingScore4SizeSimilarity: 0.0    # Min bbox size similarity score
  minMatchingScore4Iou: 0.0       # Min IOU score  

  # [Association Metric: Weights]  
  matchingScoreWeight4SizeSimilarity: 0.4    # Weight for the Size-similarity score
  matchingScoreWeight4Iou: 0.6               # Weight for the IOU score
